# Examples

## JS

The JS example showcases an app using a resnet model
for image classification with built-in pre and 
post processing using the Onnx Runtime Extensions.

You will need to install the extensions, for example, 
in Linux-like platforms use https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions/blob/main/build.sh.

Please refer to https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions for more
information on how to add pre and post processing to your model.

## Models

Some examples include a python script that can be used to create the Onnx model used in the example.
